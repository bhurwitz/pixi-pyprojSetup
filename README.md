This script generates a set of files and folder for the PyPI-style project (i.e. src-layout) with Pixi, the package and dependency manager, creates a git repository locally, and then pushes the repo to GitHub. 

Note: the script is kept within the 'pixi_pyprojSetup' directory so that it is tracked by git, and I have a shortcut externally that allows me to run it without worrying about directories. Just run it with '.lnk' at the end of the file name, i.e. 'pixi_pyprojSetup.bat.lnk'.
